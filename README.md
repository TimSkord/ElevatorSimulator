# **ElevatorSimulator**

A project simulating the work of an elevator in a world where elevators do not break and do not fall. I don't like elevators, to be honest.

## **Ideas for improvement**:
* A smart elevator that rides in such a way as to minimize the time passengers spend in it.
* A Georgian elevator that you have to pay for or it won't go.
